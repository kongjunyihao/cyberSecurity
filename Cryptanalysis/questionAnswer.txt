CHAPTE I

DOWN THE ABBIT HOLE


ALICE WAS BEGINNING TO GET VEY TIED OF SITTING BY HE SISTE
ON THE BANK  AND OF HAVING NOTHING TO DO   ONCE O TWICE SHE HAD
PEEPED INTO THE BOOK HE SISTE WAS EADING  BUT IT HAD NO
PICTUES O CONVESATIONS IN IT   AND WHAT IS THE USE OF A BOOK  
THOUGHT ALICE  WITHOUT PICTUES O CONVESATION  

SO SHE WAS CONSIDEING IN HE OWN MIND  AS WELL AS SHE COULD 
FO THE HOT DAY MADE HE FEEL VEY SLEEPY AND STUPID   WHETHE
THE PLEASUE OF MAKING A DAISY CHAIN WOULD BE WOTH THE TOUBLE
OF GETTING UP AND PICKING THE DAISIES  WHEN SUDDENLY A WHITE
ABBIT WITH PINK EYES AN CLOSE BY HE 

THEE WAS NOTHING SO VEY EMAKABLE IN THAT  NO DID ALICE
THINK IT SO VEY MUCH OUT OF THE WAY TO HEA THE ABBIT SAY TO
ITSELF   OH DEA   OH DEA   I SHALL BE LATE     WHEN SHE THOUGHT
IT OVE AFTEWADS  IT OCCUED TO HE THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE
WONDEED AT THIS  BUT AT THE TIME IT ALL SEEMED UUITE NATUAL  
BUT WHEN THE ABBIT ACTUALLY TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT 
POCKET  AND LOOKED AT IT  AND THEN HUIED ON  ALICE STATED TO
HE FEET  FO IT FLASHED ACOSS HE MIND THAT SHE HAD NEVE
BEFOE SEEN A ABBIT WITH EITHE A WAISTCOAT POCKET  O A WATCH TO
TAKE OUT OF IT  AND BUNING WITH CUIOSITY  SHE AN ACOSS THE
FIELD AFTE IT  AND FOTUNATELY WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE IT POP
DOWN A LAGE ABBIT HOLE UNDE THE HEDGE 

IN ANOTHE MOMENT DOWN WENT ALICE AFTE IT  NEVE ONCE
CONSIDEING HOW IN THE WOLD SHE WAS TO GET OUT AGAIN 

THE ABBIT HOLE WENT STAIGHT ON LIKE A TUNNEL FO SOME WAY 
AND THEN DIPPED SUDDENLY DOWN  SO SUDDENLY THAT ALICE HAD NOT A
MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT STOPPING HESELF BEFOE SHE FOUND HESELF
FALLING DOWN A VEY DEEP WELL 

EITHE THE WELL WAS VEY DEEP  O SHE FELL VEY SLOWLY  FO SHE
HAD PLENTY OF TIME AS SHE WENT DOWN TO LOOK ABOUT HE AND TO
WONDE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT   FIST  SHE TIED TO LOOK
DOWN AND MAKE OUT WHAT SHE WAS COMING TO  BUT IT WAS TOO DAK TO
SEE ANYTHING  THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE SIDES OF THE WELL  AND
NOTICED THAT THEY WEE FILLED WITH CUPBOADS AND BOOK SHELVES 
HEE AND THEE SHE SAW MAPS AND PICTUES HUNG UPON PEGS   SHE
TOOK DOWN A JA FOM ONE OF THE SHELVES AS SHE PASSED  IT WAS
LABELLED  OANGE MAMALADE   BUT TO HE GEAT DISAPPOINTMENT IT
WAS EMPTY   SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DOP THE JA FO FEA OF KILLING
SOMEBODY  SO MANAGED TO PUT IT INTO ONE OF THE CUPBOADS AS SHE
FELL PAST IT 

 WELL   THOUGHT ALICE TO HESELF   AFTE SUCH A FALL AS THIS  I
SHALL THINK NOTHING OF TUMBLING DOWN STAIS   HOW BAVE THEY LL
ALL THINK ME AT HOME   WHY  I WOULDN T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
EVEN IF I FELL OFF THE TOP OF THE HOUSE    WHICH WAS VEY LIKELY
TUE  

DOWN  DOWN  DOWN   WOULD THE FALL NEVE COME TO AN END    I
WONDE HOW MANY MILES I VE FALLEN BY THIS TIME   SHE SAID ALOUD 
 I MUST BE GETTING SOMEWHEE NEA THE CENTE OF THE EATH   LET
ME SEE   THAT WOULD BE FOU THOUSAND MILES DOWN  I THINK     FO 
YOU SEE  ALICE HAD LEANT SEVEAL THINGS OF THIS SOT IN HE
LESSONS IN THE SCHOOLOOM  AND THOUGH THIS WAS NOT A VEY GOOD
OPPOTUNITY FO SHOWING OFF HE KNOWLEDGE  AS THEE WAS NO ONE TO
LISTEN TO HE  STILL IT WAS GOOD PACTICE TO SAY IT OVE     YES 
THAT S ABOUT THE IGHT DISTANCE  BUT THEN I WONDE WHAT LATITUDE
O LONGITUDE I VE GOT TO     ALICE HAD NO IDEA WHAT LATITUDE WAS 
O LONGITUDE EITHE  BUT THOUGHT THEY WEE NICE GAND WODS TO
SAY  

PESENTLY SHE BEGAN AGAIN    I WONDE IF I SHALL FALL IGHT
THOUGH THE EATH   HOW FUNNY IT LL SEEM TO COME OUT AMONG THE
PEOPLE THAT WALK WITH THEI HEADS DOWNWAD   THE ANTIPATHIES  I
THINK     SHE WAS ATHE GLAD THEE WAS NO ONE LISTENING  THIS
TIME  AS IT DIDN T SOUND AT ALL THE IGHT WOD     BUT I SHALL
HAVE TO ASK THEM WHAT THE NAME OF THE COUNTY IS  YOU KNOW 
PLEASE  MA AM  IS THIS NEW ZEALAND O AUSTALIA    AND SHE TIED
TO CUTSEY AS SHE SPOKE  FANCY CUTSEYING AS YOU E FALLING
THOUGH THE AI   DO YOU THINK YOU COULD MANAGE IT     AND WHAT
AN IGNOANT LITTLE GIL SHE LL THINK ME FO ASKING   NO  IT LL
NEVE DO TO ASK   PEHAPS I SHALL SEE IT WITTEN UP SOMEWHEE  

DOWN  DOWN  DOWN   THEE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO  SO ALICE SOON
BEGAN TALKING AGAIN    DINAH LL MISS ME VEY MUCH TO NIGHT  I
SHOULD THINK     DINAH WAS THE CAT     I HOPE THEY LL EMEMBE
HE SAUCE OF MILK AT TEA TIME   DINAH MY DEA   I WISH YOU WEE
DOWN HEE WITH ME   THEE AE NO MICE IN THE AI  I M AFAID  BUT
YOU MIGHT CATCH A BAT  AND THAT S VEY LIKE A MOUSE  YOU KNOW 
BUT DO CATS EAT BATS  I WONDE    AND HEE ALICE BEGAN TO GET
ATHE SLEEPY  AND WENT ON SAYING TO HESELF  IN A DEAMY SOT OF
WAY   DO CATS EAT BATS   DO CATS EAT BATS   AND SOMETIMES   DO
BATS EAT CATS   FO  YOU SEE  AS SHE COULDN T ANSWE EITHE
UUESTION  IT DIDN T MUCH MATTE WHICH WAY SHE PUT IT   SHE FELT
THAT SHE WAS DOZING OFF  AND HAD JUST BEGUN TO DEAM THAT SHE
WAS WALKING HAND IN HAND WITH DINAH  AND SAYING TO HE VEY
EANESTLY   NOW  DINAH  TELL ME THE TUTH   DID YOU EVE EAT A
BAT   WHEN SUDDENLY  THUMP  THUMP  DOWN SHE CAME UPON A HEAP OF
STICKS AND DY LEAVES  AND THE FALL WAS OVE 

ALICE WAS NOT A BIT HUT  AND SHE JUMPED UP ON TO HE FEET IN A
MOMENT   SHE LOOKED UP  BUT IT WAS ALL DAK OVEHEAD  BEFOE HE
WAS ANOTHE LONG PASSAGE  AND THE WHITE ABBIT WAS STILL IN
SIGHT  HUYING DOWN IT   THEE WAS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST 
AWAY WENT ALICE LIKE THE WIND  AND WAS JUST IN TIME TO HEA IT
SAY  AS IT TUNED A CONE   OH MY EAS AND WHISKES  HOW LATE
IT S GETTING    SHE WAS CLOSE BEHIND IT WHEN SHE TUNED THE
CONE  BUT THE ABBIT WAS NO LONGE TO BE SEEN   SHE FOUND
HESELF IN A LONG  LOW HALL  WHICH WAS LIT UP BY A OW OF LAMPS
HANGING FOM THE OOF 

THEE WEE DOOS ALL OUND THE HALL  BUT THEY WEE ALL LOCKED 
AND WHEN ALICE HAD BEEN ALL THE WAY DOWN ONE SIDE AND UP THE
OTHE  TYING EVEY DOO  SHE WALKED SADLY DOWN THE MIDDLE 
WONDEING HOW SHE WAS EVE TO GET OUT AGAIN 

SUDDENLY SHE CAME UPON A LITTLE THEE LEGGED TABLE  ALL MADE OF
SOLID GLASS  THEE WAS NOTHING ON IT EXCEPT A TINY GOLDEN KEY 
AND ALICE S FIST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT MIGHT BELONG TO ONE OF THE
DOOS OF THE HALL  BUT  ALAS  EITHE THE LOCKS WEE TOO LAGE  O
THE KEY WAS TOO SMALL  BUT AT ANY ATE IT WOULD NOT OPEN ANY OF
THEM   HOWEVE  ON THE SECOND TIME OUND  SHE CAME UPON A LOW
CUTAIN SHE HAD NOT NOTICED BEFOE  AND BEHIND IT WAS A LITTLE
DOO ABOUT FIFTEEN INCHES HIGH   SHE TIED THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY
IN THE LOCK  AND TO HE GEAT DELIGHT IT FITTED 

ALICE OPENED THE DOO AND FOUND THAT IT LED INTO A SMALL
PASSAGE  NOT MUCH LAGE THAN A AT HOLE   SHE KNELT DOWN AND
LOOKED ALONG THE PASSAGE INTO THE LOVELIEST GADEN YOU EVE SAW 
HOW SHE LONGED TO GET OUT OF THAT DAK HALL  AND WANDE ABOUT
AMONG THOSE BEDS OF BIGHT FLOWES AND THOSE COOL FOUNTAINS  BUT
SHE COULD NOT EVEN GET HE HEAD THOUGH THE DOOWAY   AND EVEN IF
MY HEAD WOULD GO THOUGH   THOUGHT POO ALICE   IT WOULD BE OF
VEY LITTLE USE WITHOUT MY SHOULDES   OH  HOW I WISH
I COULD SHUT UP LIKE A TELESCOPE   I THINK I COULD  IF I ONLY
KNOW HOW TO BEGIN    FO  YOU SEE  SO MANY OUT OF THE WAY THINGS
HAD HAPPENED LATELY  THAT ALICE HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT VEY FEW
THINGS INDEED WEE EALLY IMPOSSIBLE 

THEE SEEMED TO BE NO USE IN WAITING BY THE LITTLE DOO  SO SHE
WENT BACK TO THE TABLE  HALF HOPING SHE MIGHT FIND ANOTHE KEY ON
IT  O AT ANY ATE A BOOK OF ULES FO SHUTTING PEOPLE UP LIKE
TELESCOPES   THIS TIME SHE FOUND A LITTLE BOTTLE ON IT    WHICH
CETAINLY WAS NOT HEE BEFOE   SAID ALICE   AND OUND THE NECK
OF THE BOTTLE WAS A PAPE LABEL  WITH THE WODS  DINK ME 
BEAUTIFULLY PINTED ON IT IN LAGE LETTES 

IT WAS ALL VEY WELL TO SAY  DINK ME   BUT THE WISE LITTLE
ALICE WAS NOT GOING TO DO THAT IN A HUY    NO  I LL LOOK
FIST   SHE SAID   AND SEE WHETHE IT S MAKED  POISON  O NOT  
FO SHE HAD EAD SEVEAL NICE LITTLE HISTOIES ABOUT CHILDEN WHO
HAD GOT BUNT  AND EATEN UP BY WILD BEASTS AND OTHE UNPLEASANT
THINGS  ALL BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT EMEMBE THE SIMPLE ULES
THEI FIENDS HAD TAUGHT THEM   SUCH AS  THAT A ED HOT POKE
WILL BUN YOU IF YOU HOLD IT TOO LONG  AND THAT IF YOU CUT YOU
FINGE VEY DEEPLY WITH A KNIFE  IT USUALLY BLEEDS  AND SHE HAD
NEVE FOGOTTEN THAT  IF YOU DINK MUCH FOM A BOTTLE MAKED
 POISON   IT IS ALMOST CETAIN TO DISAGEE WITH YOU  SOONE O
LATE 

HOWEVE  THIS BOTTLE WAS NOT MAKED  POISON   SO ALICE VENTUED
TO TASTE IT  AND FINDING IT VEY NICE   IT HAD  IN FACT  A SOT
OF MIXED FLAVOU OF CHEY TAT  CUSTAD  PINE APPLE  OAST
TUKEY  TOFFEE  AND HOT BUTTEED TOAST   SHE VEY SOON FINISHED
IT OFF 

                                                 

                                         

                                                 

 WHAT A CUIOUS FEELING   SAID ALICE   I MUST BE SHUTTING UP
LIKE A TELESCOPE  

AND SO IT WAS INDEED   SHE WAS NOW ONLY TEN INCHES HIGH  AND
HE FACE BIGHTENED UP AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS NOW THE IGHT
SIZE FO GOING THOUGH THE LITTLE DOO INTO THAT LOVELY GADEN 
FIST  HOWEVE  SHE WAITED FO A FEW MINUTES TO SEE IF SHE WAS
GOING TO SHINK ANY FUTHE   SHE FELT A LITTLE NEVOUS ABOUT
THIS   FO IT MIGHT END  YOU KNOW   SAID ALICE TO HESELF   IN MY
GOING OUT ALTOGETHE  LIKE A CANDLE   I WONDE WHAT I SHOULD BE
LIKE THEN    AND SHE TIED TO FANCY WHAT THE FLAME OF A CANDLE IS
LIKE AFTE THE CANDLE IS BLOWN OUT  FO SHE COULD NOT EMEMBE
EVE HAVING SEEN SUCH A THING 

AFTE A WHILE  FINDING THAT NOTHING MOE HAPPENED  SHE DECIDED
ON GOING INTO THE GADEN AT ONCE  BUT  ALAS FO POO ALICE 
WHEN SHE GOT TO THE DOO  SHE FOUND SHE HAD FOGOTTEN THE
LITTLE GOLDEN KEY  AND WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE FO IT 
SHE FOUND SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY EACH IT   SHE COULD SEE IT
UUITE PLAINLY THOUGH THE GLASS  AND SHE TIED HE BEST TO CLIMB
UP ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE TABLE  BUT IT WAS TOO SLIPPEY 
AND WHEN SHE HAD TIED HESELF OUT WITH TYING 
THE POO LITTLE THING SAT DOWN AND CIED 

 COME  THEE S NO USE IN CYING LIKE THAT   SAID ALICE TO
HESELF  ATHE SHAPLY   I ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE OFF THIS MINUTE  
SHE GENEALLY GAVE HESELF VEY GOOD ADVICE   THOUGH SHE VEY
SELDOM FOLLOWED IT   AND SOMETIMES SHE SCOLDED HESELF SO
SEVEELY AS TO BING TEAS INTO HE EYES  AND ONCE SHE EMEMBEED
TYING TO BOX HE OWN EAS FO HAVING CHEATED HESELF IN A GAME
OF COUUET SHE WAS PLAYING AGAINST HESELF  FO THIS CUIOUS
CHILD WAS VEY FOND OF PETENDING TO BE TWO PEOPLE    BUT IT S NO
USE NOW   THOUGHT POO ALICE   TO PETEND TO BE TWO PEOPLE   WHY 
THEE S HADLY ENOUGH OF ME LEFT TO MAKE ONE ESPECTABLE
PESON  

SOON HE EYE FELL ON A LITTLE GLASS BOX THAT WAS LYING UNDE
THE TABLE   SHE OPENED IT  AND FOUND IN IT A VEY SMALL CAKE  ON
WHICH THE WODS  EAT ME  WEE BEAUTIFULLY MAKED IN CUANTS 
 WELL  I LL EAT IT   SAID ALICE   AND IF IT MAKES ME GOW LAGE 
I CAN EACH THE KEY  AND IF IT MAKES ME GOW SMALLE  I CAN CEEP
UNDE THE DOO  SO EITHE WAY I LL GET INTO THE GADEN  AND I
DON T CAE WHICH HAPPENS  

SHE ATE A LITTLE BIT  AND SAID ANXIOUSLY TO HESELF   WHICH
WAY   WHICH WAY    HOLDING HE HAND ON THE TOP OF HE HEAD TO
FEEL WHICH WAY IT WAS GOWING  AND SHE WAS UUITE SUPISED TO
FIND THAT SHE EMAINED THE SAME SIZE   TO BE SUE  THIS GENEALLY
HAPPENS WHEN ONE EATS CAKE  BUT ALICE HAD GOT SO MUCH INTO THE
WAY OF EXPECTING NOTHING BUT OUT OF THE WAY THINGS TO HAPPEN 
THAT IT SEEMED UUITE DULL AND STUPID FO LIFE TO GO ON IN THE
COMMON WAY 

SO SHE SET TO WOK  AND VEY SOON FINISHED OFF THE CAKE 

                                                 

                                         

                                                 




CHAPTE II

 CUIOUSE AND CUIOUSE   CIED ALICE  SHE WAS SO MUCH
SUPISED  THAT FO THE MOMENT SHE UUITE FOGOT HOW TO SPEAK GOOD
ENGLISH    NOW I M OPENING OUT LIKE THE LAGEST TELESCOPE THAT
EVE WAS   GOOD BYE  FEET    FO WHEN SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HE

KIND TO THEM   THOUGHT ALICE   O PEHAPS THEY WON T WALK THE
WAY I WANT TO GO   LET ME SEE   I LL GIVE THEM A NEW PAI OF
BOOTS EVEY CHISTMAS  

AND SHE WENT ON PLANNING TO HESELF HOW SHE WOULD MANAGE IT

DIECTIONS WILL LOOK 

ALICE S IGHT FOOT  ESU

OH DEA  WHAT NONSENSE I M TALKING  

JUST THEN HE HEAD STUCK AGAINST THE OOF OF THE HALL   IN
FACT SHE WAS NOW MOE THAN NINE FEET HIGH  AND SHE AT ONCE TOOK
UP THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY AND HUIED OFF TO THE GADEN DOO 

POO ALICE   IT WAS AS MUCH AS SHE COULD DO  LYING DOWN ON ONE
SIDE  TO LOOK THOUGH INTO THE GADEN WITH ONE EYE  BUT TO GET
THOUGH WAS MOE HOPELESS THAN EVE   SHE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO

 YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOUSELF   SAID ALICE   A GEAT
GIL LIKE YOU    SHE MIGHT WELL SAY THIS    TO GO ON CYING IN
THIS WAY   STOP THIS MOMENT  I TELL YOU    BUT SHE WENT ON ALL
THE SAME  SHEDDING GALLONS OF TEAS  UNTIL THEE WAS A LAGE POOL
ALL OUND HE  ABOUT FOU INCHES DEEP AND EACHING HALF DOWN THE
HALL 

AFTE A TIME SHE HEAD A LITTLE PATTEING OF FEET IN THE
DISTANCE  AND SHE HASTILY DIED HE EYES TO SEE WHAT WAS COMING 
IT WAS THE WHITE ABBIT ETUNING  SPLENDIDLY DESSED  WITH A
PAI OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LAGE FAN IN THE
OTHE   HE CAME TOTTING ALONG IN A GEAT HUY  MUTTEING TO
HIMSELF AS HE CAME   OH  THE DUCHESS  THE DUCHESS  OH  WON T SHE
BE SAVAGE IF I VE KEPT HE WAITING    ALICE FELT SO DESPEATE
THAT SHE WAS EADY TO ASK HELP OF ANY ONE  SO  WHEN THE ABBIT

SI     THE ABBIT STATED VIOLENTLY  DOPPED THE WHITE KID
GLOVES AND THE FAN  AND SKUIED AWAY INTO THE DAKNESS AS HAD
AS HE COULD GO 

ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES  AND  AS THE HALL WAS VEY
HOT  SHE KEPT FANNING HESELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING 
 DEA  DEA   HOW UUEE EVEYTHING IS TO DAY   AND YESTEDAY
THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL   I WONDE IF I VE BEEN CHANGED IN
THE NIGHT   LET ME THINK   WAS I THE SAME WHEN I GOT UP THIS
MONING   I ALMOST THINK I CAN EMEMBE FEELING A LITTLE
DIFFEENT   BUT IF I M NOT THE SAME  THE NEXT UUESTION IS  WHO IN
THE WOLD AM I   AH  THAT S THE GEAT PUZZLE    AND SHE BEGAN
THINKING OVE ALL THE CHILDEN SHE KNEW THAT WEE OF THE SAME AGE

THEM 

 I M SUE I M NOT ADA   SHE SAID   FO HE HAI GOES IN SUCH

AND SHE COSSED HE HANDS ON HE LAP AS IF SHE WEE SAYING LESSONS

STANGE  AND THE WODS DID NOT COME THE SAME AS THEY USED TO DO   

 HOW DOTH THE LITTLE COCODILE

AND POU THE WATES OF THE NILE
ON EVEY GOLDEN SCALE 

 HOW CHEEFULLY HE SEEMS TO GIN 
HOW NEATLY SPEAD HIS CLAWS

SUDDEN BUST OF TEAS   I DO WISH THEY WOULD PUT THEI HEADS

AS SHE SAID THIS SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HE HANDS  AND WAS
SUPISED TO SEE THAT SHE HAD PUT ON ONE OF THE ABBIT S LITTLE
WHITE KID GLOVES WHILE SHE WAS TALKING    HOW CAN I HAVE DONE
THAT   SHE THOUGHT    I MUST BE GOWING SMALL AGAIN    SHE GOT UP
AND WENT TO THE TABLE TO MEASUE HESELF BY IT  AND FOUND THAT 
AS NEALY AS SHE COULD GUESS  SHE WAS NOW ABOUT TWO FEET HIGH 
AND WAS GOING ON SHINKING APIDLY   SHE SOON FOUND OUT THAT THE
CAUSE OF THIS WAS THE FAN SHE WAS HOLDING  AND SHE DOPPED IT
HASTILY  JUST IN TIME TO AVOID SHINKING AWAY ALTOGETHE 

 THAT WAS A NAOW ESCAPE   SAID ALICE  A GOOD DEAL FIGHTENED AT
THE SUDDEN CHANGE  BUT VEY GLAD TO FIND HESELF STILL IN
EXISTENCE   AND NOW FO THE GADEN   AND SHE AN WITH ALL SPEED
BACK TO THE LITTLE DOO   BUT  ALAS  THE LITTLE DOO WAS SHUT
AGAIN  AND THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY WAS LYING ON THE GLASS TABLE AS
BEFOE   AND THINGS AE WOSE THAN EVE   THOUGHT THE POO CHILD 
 FO I NEVE WAS SO SMALL AS THIS BEFOE  NEVE   AND I DECLAE
IT S TOO BAD  THAT IT IS  

AS SHE SAID THESE WODS HE FOOT SLIPPED  AND IN ANOTHE
MOMENT  SPLASH  SHE WAS UP TO HE CHIN IN SALT WATE   HE FIST
IDEA WAS THAT SHE HAD SOMEHOW FALLEN INTO THE SEA   AND IN THAT
CASE I CAN GO BACK BY AILWAY   SHE SAID TO HESELF    ALICE HAD
BEEN TO THE SEASIDE ONCE IN HE LIFE  AND HAD COME TO THE GENEAL
CONCLUSION  THAT WHEEVE YOU GO TO ON THE ENGLISH COAST YOU FIND
A NUMBE OF BATHING MACHINES IN THE SEA  SOME CHILDEN DIGGING IN
THE SAND WITH WOODEN SPADES  THEN A OW OF LODGING HOUSES  AND
BEHIND THEM A AILWAY STATION    HOWEVE  SHE SOON MADE OUT THAT
SHE WAS IN THE POOL OF TEAS WHICH SHE HAD WEPT WHEN SHE WAS NINE
FEET HIGH 

 I WISH I HADN T CIED SO MUCH   SAID ALICE  AS SHE SWAM ABOUT 
TYING TO FIND HE WAY OUT    I SHALL BE PUNISHED FO IT NOW  I
SUPPOSE  BY BEING DOWNED IN MY OWN TEAS   THAT WILL BE A UUEE
THING  TO BE SUE   HOWEVE  EVEYTHING IS UUEE TO DAY  

JUST THEN SHE HEAD SOMETHING SPLASHING ABOUT IN THE POOL A
LITTLE WAY OFF  AND SHE SWAM NEAE TO MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS   AT
FIST SHE THOUGHT IT MUST BE A WALUS O HIPPOPOTAMUS  BUT THEN
SHE EMEMBEED HOW SMALL SHE WAS NOW  AND SHE SOON MADE OUT THAT
IT WAS ONLY A MOUSE THAT HAD SLIPPED IN LIKE HESELF

MOUSE   EVEYTHING IS SO OUT OF THE WAY DOWN HEE  THAT I SHOULD
THINK VEY LIKELY IT CAN TALK   AT ANY ATE  THEE S NO HAM IN
TYING    SO SHE BEGAN    O MOUSE  DO YOU KNOW THE WAY OUT OF

 WILLIAM THE CONUUEO  WHOSE CAUSE WAS FAVOUED BY THE POPE  WAS

OF LATE MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO USUPATION AND CONUUEST   EDWIN AND
MOCA  THE EALS OF MECIA AND NOTHUMBIA    

 UGH   SAID THE LOY  WITH A SHIVE 

 I BEG YOU PADON   SAID THE MOUSE  FOWNING  BUT VEY
POLITELY    DID YOU SPEAK

 I THOUGHT YOU DID   SAID THE MOUSE      I POCEED    EDWIN AND
MOCA  THE EALS OF MECIA AND NOTHUMBIA  DECLAED FO HIM 
AND EVEN STIGAND  THE PATIOTIC ACHBISHOP OF CANTEBUY  FOUND
IT ADVISABLE    

 FOUND WHAT   SAID THE DUCK 

 FOUND IT   THE MOUSE EPLIED ATHE COSSLY    OF COUSE YOU

 I KNOW WHAT  IT  MEANS WELL ENOUGH  WHEN I FIND A THING   SAID
THE DUCK    IT S GENEALLY A FOG O A WOM   THE UUESTION IS 
WHAT DID THE ACHBISHOP FIND  

THE MOUSE DID NOT NOTICE THIS UUESTION  BUT HUIEDLY WENT ON 
    FOUND IT ADVISABLE TO GO WITH EDGA ATHELING TO MEET WILLIAM
AND OFFE HIM THE COWN   WILLIAM S CONDUCT AT FIST WAS
MODEATE   BUT THE INSOLENCE OF HIS NOMANS     HOW AE YOU
GETTING ON NOW  MY DEA   IT CONTINUED  TUNING TO ALICE AS IT
SPOKE 

 AS WET AS EVE   SAID ALICE IN A MELANCHOLY TONE    IT DOESN T
SEEM TO DY ME AT ALL  

 IN THAT CASE   SAID THE DODO SOLEMNLY  ISING TO ITS FEET   I
MOVE THAT THE MEETING ADJOUN  FO THE IMMEDIATE ADOPTION OF MOE
ENEGETIC EMEDIES   

 SPEAK ENGLISH   SAID THE EAGLET    I DON T KNOW THE MEANING OF
HALF THOSE LONG WODS  AND  WHAT S MOE  I DON T BELIEVE YOU DO
EITHE    AND THE EAGLET BENT DOWN ITS HEAD TO HIDE A SMILE 
SOME OF THE OTHE BIDS TITTEED AUDIBLY 

 WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY   SAID THE DODO IN AN OFFENDED TONE 
 WAS  THAT THE BEST THING TO GET US DY WOULD BE A CAUCUS ACE  

 WHAT IS A CAUCUS ACE   SAID ALICE  NOT THAT SHE WANTED MUCH
TO KNOW  BUT THE DODO HAD PAUSED AS IF IT THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY
OUGHT TO SPEAK  AND NO ONE ELSE SEEMED INCLINED TO SAY ANYTHING 

 WHY   SAID THE DODO   THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT IS TO DO IT  
 AND  AS YOU MIGHT LIKE TO TY THE THING YOUSELF  SOME WINTE
DAY  I WILL TELL YOU HOW THE DODO MANAGED IT  

FIST IT MAKED OUT A ACE COUSE  IN A SOT OF CICLE    THE
EXACT SHAPE DOESN T MATTE   IT SAID   AND THEN ALL THE PATY
WEE PLACED ALONG THE COUSE  HEE AND THEE   THEE WAS NO  ONE 
TWO  THEE  AND AWAY   BUT THEY BEGAN UNNING WHEN THEY LIKED 
AND LEFT OFF WHEN THEY LIKED  SO THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO KNOW
WHEN THE ACE WAS OVE   HOWEVE  WHEN THEY HAD BEEN UNNING HALF
AN HOU O SO  AND WEE UUITE DY AGAIN  THE DODO SUDDENLY CALLED
OUT  THE ACE IS OVE   AND THEY ALL COWDED OUND IT  PANTING 
AND ASKING   BUT WHO HAS WON  

THIS UUESTION THE DODO COULD NOT ANSWE WITHOUT A GEAT DEAL OF
THOUGHT  AND IT SAT FO A LONG TIME WITH ONE FINGE PESSED UPON
ITS FOEHEAD  THE POSITION IN WHICH YOU USUALLY SEE SHAKESPEAE 
IN THE PICTUES OF HIM   WHILE THE EST WAITED IN SILENCE   AT
LAST THE DODO SAID   EVEYBODY HAS WON  AND ALL MUST HAVE
PIZES  

 BUT WHO IS TO GIVE THE PIZES   UUITE A CHOUS OF VOICES
ASKED 

 WHY  SHE  OF COUSE   SAID THE DODO  POINTING TO ALICE WITH
ONE FINGE  AND THE WHOLE PATY AT ONCE COWDED OUND HE 
CALLING OUT IN A CONFUSED WAY   PIZES  PIZES  

ALICE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO  AND IN DESPAI SHE PUT HE HAND
IN HE POCKET  AND PULLED OUT A BOX OF COMFITS   LUCKILY THE SALT
WATE HAD NOT GOT INTO IT   AND HANDED THEM OUND AS PIZES 
THEE WAS EXACTLY ONE A PIECE ALL OUND 

 BUT SHE MUST HAVE A PIZE HESELF  YOU KNOW   SAID THE MOUSE 

 OF COUSE   THE DODO EPLIED VEY GAVELY    WHAT ELSE HAVE

 HAND IT OVE HEE   SAID THE DODO 

THEN THEY ALL COWDED OUND HE ONCE MOE  WHILE THE DODO
SOLEMNLY PESENTED THE THIMBLE  SAYING  WE BEG YOU ACCEPTANCE OF
THIS ELEGANT THIMBLE   AND  WHEN IT HAD FINISHED THIS SHOT
SPEECH  THEY ALL CHEEED 

ALICE THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING VEY ABSUD  BUT THEY ALL LOOKED
SO GAVE THAT SHE DID NOT DAE TO LAUGH  AND  AS SHE COULD NOT
THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY  SHE SIMPLY BOWED  AND TOOK THE THIMBLE 
LOOKING AS SOLEMN AS SHE COULD 

THE NEXT THING WAS TO EAT THE COMFITS   THIS CAUSED SOME NOISE
AND CONFUSION  AS THE LAGE BIDS COMPLAINED THAT THEY COULD NOT
TASTE THEIS  AND THE SMALL ONES CHOKED AND HAD TO BE PATTED ON
THE BACK   HOWEVE  IT WAS OVE AT LAST  AND THEY SAT DOWN AGAIN
IN A ING  AND BEGGED THE MOUSE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING MOE

ALICE  AND SIGHING 

 IT IS A LONG TAIL  CETAINLY   SAID ALICE  LOOKING DOWN WITH
WONDE AT THE MOUSE S TAIL   BUT WHY DO YOU CALL IT SAD    AND

IT WAS THE WHITE ABBIT  TOTTING SLOWLY BACK AGAIN  AND
LOOKING ANXIOUSLY ABOUT AS IT WENT  AS IF IT HAD LOST SOMETHING

 HOW SUPISED HE LL BE WHEN HE FINDS OUT WHO I AM   BUT I D
BETTE TAKE HIM HIS FAN AND GLOVES  THAT IS  IF I CAN FIND THEM  
AS SHE SAID THIS  SHE CAME UPON A NEAT LITTLE HOUSE  ON THE DOO
OF WHICH WAS A BIGHT BASS PLATE WITH THE NAME  W  ABBIT 
ENGAVED UPON IT   SHE WENT IN WITHOUT KNOCKING  AND HUIED
UPSTAIS  IN GEAT FEA LEST SHE SHOULD MEET THE EAL MAY ANN 
AND BE TUNED OUT OF THE HOUSE BEFOE SHE HAD FOUND THE FAN AND
GLOVES 

 HOW UUEE IT SEEMS   ALICE SAID TO HESELF   TO BE GOING

MESSAGES NEXT    AND SHE BEGAN FANCYING THE SOT OF THING THAT
WOULD HAPPEN     MISS ALICE   COME HEE DIECTLY  AND GET EADY
FO YOU WALK    COMING IN A MINUTE  NUSE   BUT I VE GOT TO SEE
THAT THE MOUSE DOESN T GET OUT    ONLY I DON T THINK   ALICE WENT
ON   THAT THEY D LET DINAH STOP IN THE HOUSE IF IT BEGAN ODEING
PEOPLE ABOUT LIKE THAT  

BY THIS TIME SHE HAD FOUND HE WAY INTO A TIDY LITTLE OOM WITH
A TABLE IN THE WINDOW  AND ON IT  AS SHE HAD HOPED  A FAN AND TWO
O THEE PAIS OF TINY WHITE KID GLOVES   SHE TOOK UP THE FAN AND
A PAI OF THE GLOVES  AND WAS JUST GOING TO LEAVE THE OOM  WHEN
HE EYE FELL UPON A LITTLE BOTTLE THAT STOOD NEA THE LOOKING 
GLASS   THEE WAS NO LABEL THIS TIME WITH THE WODS  DINK ME  
BUT NEVETHELESS SHE UNCOKED IT AND PUT IT TO HE LIPS    I KNOW
SOMETHING INTEESTING IS SUE TO HAPPEN   SHE SAID TO HESELF 
 WHENEVE I EAT O DINK ANYTHING  SO I LL JUST SEE WHAT THIS
BOTTLE DOES   I DO HOPE IT LL MAKE ME GOW LAGE AGAIN  FO

 THAT S UUITE ENOUGH  I HOPE I SHAN T GOW ANY MOE  AS IT IS  I

ALAS  IT WAS TOO LATE TO WISH THAT   SHE WENT ON GOWING  AND
GOWING  AND VEY SOON HAD TO KNEEL DOWN ON THE FLOO   IN
ANOTHE MINUTE THEE WAS NOT EVEN OOM FO THIS  AND SHE TIED
THE EFFECT OF LYING DOWN WITH ONE ELBOW AGAINST THE DOO  AND THE

AS A LAST ESOUCE  SHE PUT ONE AM OUT OF THE WINDOW  AND ONE
FOOT UP THE CHIMNEY  AND SAID TO HESELF  NOW I CAN DO NO MOE 
WHATEVE HAPPENS   WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME  

LUCKILY FO ALICE  THE LITTLE MAGIC BOTTLE HAD NOW HAD ITS FULL
EFFECT  AND SHE GEW NO LAGE   STILL IT WAS VEY UNCOMFOTABLE 
AND  AS THEE SEEMED TO BE NO SOT OF CHANCE OF HE EVE GETTING
OUT OF THE OOM AGAIN  NO WONDE SHE FELT UNHAPPY 

 IT WAS MUCH PLEASANTE AT HOME   THOUGHT POO ALICE   WHEN ONE

MINUTES SHE HEAD A VOICE OUTSIDE  AND STOPPED TO LISTEN 

 MAY ANN   MAY ANN   SAID THE VOICE    FETCH ME MY GLOVES

STAIS   ALICE KNEW IT WAS THE ABBIT COMING TO LOOK FO HE  AND
SHE TEMBLED TILL SHE SHOOK THE HOUSE  UUITE FOGETTING THAT SHE
WAS NOW ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES AS LAGE AS THE ABBIT  AND HAD NO
EASON TO BE AFAID OF IT 

PESENTLY THE ABBIT CAME UP TO THE DOO  AND TIED TO OPEN IT

SHE WAITED FO SOME TIME WITHOUT HEAING ANYTHING MOE   AT

GOOD MANY VOICES ALL TALKING TOGETHE   SHE MADE OUT THE WODS 
 WHEE S THE OTHE LADDE   WHY  I HADN T TO BING BUT ONE

I WOULDN T BE IN BILL S PLACE FO A GOOD DEAL   THIS FIEPLACE IS
NAOW  TO BE SUE  BUT I THINK I CAN KICK A LITTLE  

SHE DEW HE FOOT AS FA DOWN THE CHIMNEY AS SHE COULD  AND
WAITED TILL SHE HEAD A LITTLE ANIMAL  SHE COULDN T GUESS OF WHAT
SOT IT WAS  SCATCHING AND SCAMBLING ABOUT IN THE CHIMNEY CLOSE
ABOVE HE   THEN  SAYING TO HESELF  THIS IS BILL   SHE GAVE ONE
SHAP KICK  AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT 

THE FIST THING SHE HEAD WAS A GENEAL CHOUS OF  THEE GOES
BILL   THEN THE ABBIT S VOICE ALONG   CATCH HIM  YOU BY THE
HEDGE   THEN SILENCE  AND THEN ANOTHE CONFUSION OF VOICES   HOLD
UP HIS HEAD  BANDY NOW  DON T CHOKE HIM  HOW WAS IT  OLD FELLOW 
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU   TELL US ALL ABOUT IT  

LAST CAME A LITTLE FEEBLE  SUUEAKING VOICE    THAT S BILL  
THOUGHT ALICE    WELL  I HADLY KNOW  NO MOE  THANK YE  I M
BETTE NOW  BUT I M A DEAL TOO FLUSTEED TO TELL YOU  ALL I KNOW
IS  SOMETHING COMES AT ME LIKE A JACK IN THE BOX  AND UP I GOES
LIKE A SKY OCKET  

 SO YOU DID  OLD FELLOW   SAID THE OTHES 

 WE MUST BUN THE HOUSE DOWN   SAID THE ABBIT S VOICE  AND
ALICE CALLED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD   IF YOU DO   I LL SET
DINAH AT YOU  

THEE WAS A DEAD SILENCE INSTANTLY  AND ALICE THOUGHT TO
HESELF   I WONDE WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT   IF THEY HAD ANY
SENSE  THEY D TAKE THE OOF OFF    AFTE A MINUTE O TWO  THEY
BEGAN MOVING ABOUT AGAIN  AND ALICE HEAD THE ABBIT SAY   A
BAOWFUL WILL DO  TO BEGIN WITH  

 A BAOWFUL OF WHAT   THOUGHT ALICE  BUT SHE HAD NOT LONG TO
DOUBT  FO THE NEXT MOMENT A SHOWE OF LITTLE PEBBLES CAME
ATTLING IN AT THE WINDOW  AND SOME OF THEM HIT HE IN THE FACE 
 I LL PUT A STOP TO THIS   SHE SAID TO HESELF  AND SHOUTED OUT 
 YOU D BETTE NOT DO THAT AGAIN   WHICH PODUCED ANOTHE DEAD
SILENCE 

ALICE NOTICED WITH SOME SUPISE THAT THE PEBBLES WEE ALL
TUNING INTO LITTLE CAKES AS THEY LAY ON THE FLOO  AND A BIGHT
IDEA CAME INTO HE HEAD    IF I EAT ONE OF THESE CAKES   SHE
THOUGHT   IT S SUE TO MAKE SOME CHANGE IN MY SIZE  AND AS IT
CAN T POSSIBLY MAKE ME LAGE  IT MUST MAKE ME SMALLE  I
SUPPOSE  

SO SHE SWALLOWED ONE OF THE CAKES  AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND
THAT SHE BEGAN SHINKING DIECTLY   AS SOON AS SHE WAS SMALL
ENOUGH TO GET THOUGH THE DOO  SHE AN OUT OF THE HOUSE  AND
FOUND UUITE A COWD OF LITTLE ANIMALS AND BIDS WAITING OUTSIDE 
THE POO LITTLE LIZAD  BILL  WAS IN THE MIDDLE  BEING HELD UP BY
TWO GUINEA PIGS  WHO WEE GIVING IT SOMETHING OUT OF A BOTTLE 
THEY ALL MADE A USH AT ALICE THE MOMENT SHE APPEAED  BUT SHE
AN OFF AS HAD AS SHE COULD  AND SOON FOUND HESELF SAFE IN A
THICK WOOD 

 THE FIST THING I VE GOT TO DO   SAID ALICE TO HESELF  AS SHE
WANDEED ABOUT IN THE WOOD   IS TO GOW TO MY IGHT SIZE AGAIN 
AND THE SECOND THING IS TO FIND MY WAY INTO THAT LOVELY GADEN 
I THINK THAT WILL BE THE BEST PLAN  

IT SOUNDED AN EXCELLENT PLAN  NO DOUBT  AND VEY NEATLY AND
SIMPLY AANGED  THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS  THAT SHE HAD NOT THE
SMALLEST IDEA HOW TO SET ABOUT IT  AND WHILE SHE WAS PEEING
ABOUT ANXIOUSLY AMONG THE TEES  A LITTLE SHAP BAK JUST OVE
HE HEAD MADE HE LOOK UP IN A GEAT HUY 

AN ENOMOUS PUPPY WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HE WITH LAGE OUND
EYES  AND FEEBLY STETCHING OUT ONE PAW  TYING TO TOUCH HE 
 POO LITTLE THING   SAID ALICE  IN A COAXING TONE  AND SHE TIED
HAD TO WHISTLE TO IT  BUT SHE WAS TEIBLY FIGHTENED ALL THE
TIME AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE HUNGY  IN WHICH CASE IT
WOULD BE VEY LIKELY TO EAT HE UP IN SPITE OF ALL HE COAXING 

HADLY KNOWING WHAT SHE DID  SHE PICKED UP A LITTLE BIT OF
STICK  AND HELD IT OUT TO THE PUPPY  WHEEUPON THE PUPPY JUMPED
INTO THE AI OFF ALL ITS FEET AT ONCE  WITH A YELP OF DELIGHT 
AND USHED AT THE STICK  AND MADE BELIEVE TO WOY IT  THEN ALICE
DODGED BEHIND A GEAT THISTLE  TO KEEP HESELF FOM BEING UN
OVE  AND THE MOMENT SHE APPEAED ON THE OTHE SIDE  THE PUPPY
MADE ANOTHE USH AT THE STICK  AND TUMBLED HEAD OVE HEELS IN
ITS HUY TO GET HOLD OF IT  THEN ALICE  THINKING IT WAS VEY
LIKE HAVING A GAME OF PLAY WITH A CAT HOSE  AND EXPECTING EVEY
MOMENT TO BE TAMPLED UNDE ITS FEET  AN OUND THE THISTLE
AGAIN  THEN THE PUPPY BEGAN A SEIES OF SHOT CHAGES AT THE
STICK  UNNING A VEY LITTLE WAY FOWADS EACH TIME AND A LONG
WAY BACK  AND BAKING HOASELY ALL THE WHILE  TILL AT LAST IT SAT
DOWN A GOOD WAY OFF  PANTING  WITH ITS TONGUE HANGING OUT OF ITS
MOUTH  AND ITS GEAT EYES HALF SHUT 

THIS SEEMED TO ALICE A GOOD OPPOTUNITY FO MAKING HE ESCAPE 
SO SHE SET OFF AT ONCE  AND AN TILL SHE WAS UUITE TIED AND OUT
OF BEATH  AND TILL THE PUPPY S BAK SOUNDED UUITE FAINT IN THE
DISTANCE 

 AND YET WHAT A DEA LITTLE PUPPY IT WAS   SAID ALICE  AS SHE
LEANT AGAINST A BUTTECUP TO EST HESELF  AND FANNED HESELF
WITH ONE OF THE LEAVES    I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TEACHING IT TICKS
VEY MUCH  IF  IF I D ONLY BEEN THE IGHT SIZE TO DO IT   OH
DEA   I D NEALY FOGOTTEN THAT I VE GOT TO GOW UP AGAIN   LET
ME SEE  HOW IS IT TO BE MANAGED   I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO EAT O
DINK SOMETHING O OTHE  BUT THE GEAT UUESTION IS  WHAT  

THE GEAT UUESTION CETAINLY WAS  WHAT   ALICE LOOKED ALL OUND
HE AT THE FLOWES AND THE BLADES OF GASS  BUT SHE DID NOT SEE

HOWEVE  AT LAST SHE STETCHED HE AMS OUND IT AS FA AS THEY
WOULD GO  AND BOKE OFF A BIT OF THE EDGE WITH EACH HAND 

 AND NOW WHICH IS WHICH   SHE SAID TO HESELF  AND NIBBLED A
LITTLE OF THE IGHT HAND BIT TO TY THE EFFECT   THE NEXT MOMENT

FOOT 

SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL FIGHTENED BY THIS VEY SUDDEN CHANGE  BUT
SHE FELT THAT THEE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST  AS SHE WAS SHINKING
APIDLY  SO SHE SET TO WOK AT ONCE TO EAT SOME OF THE OTHE BIT 
HE CHIN WAS PESSED SO CLOSELY AGAINST HE FOOT  THAT THEE WAS
HADLY OOM TO OPEN HE MOUTH  BUT SHE DID IT AT LAST  AND
MANAGED TO SWALLOW A MOSEL OF THE LEFTHAND BIT 


                                                 

                                         

                                                 

 COME  MY HEAD S FEE AT LAST   SAID ALICE IN A TONE OF
DELIGHT  WHICH CHANGED INTO ALAM IN ANOTHE MOMENT  WHEN SHE
FOUND THAT HE SHOULDES WEE NOWHEE TO BE FOUND   ALL SHE COULD
SEE  WHEN SHE LOOKED DOWN  WAS AN IMMENSE LENGTH OF NECK  WHICH
SEEMED TO ISE LIKE A STALK OUT OF A SEA OF GEEN LEAVES THAT LAY
FA BELOW HE 

 WHAT CAN ALL THAT GEEN STUFF BE   SAID ALICE    AND WHEE
HAVE MY SHOULDES GOT TO   AND OH  MY POO HANDS  HOW IS IT I
CAN T SEE YOU    SHE WAS MOVING THEM ABOUT AS SHE SPOKE  BUT NO
ESULT SEEMED TO FOLLOW  EXCEPT A LITTLE SHAKING AMONG THE
DISTANT GEEN LEAVES 

AS THEE SEEMED TO BE NO CHANCE OF GETTING HE HANDS UP TO HE
HEAD  SHE TIED TO GET HE HEAD DOWN TO THEM  AND WAS DELIGHTED
TO FIND THAT HE NECK WOULD BEND ABOUT EASILY IN ANY DIECTION 
LIKE A SEPENT   SHE HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CUVING IT DOWN INTO A
GACEFUL ZIGZAG  AND WAS GOING TO DIVE IN AMONG THE LEAVES  WHICH
SHE FOUND TO BE NOTHING BUT THE TOPS OF THE TEES UNDE WHICH SHE
HAD BEEN WANDEING  WHEN A SHAP HISS MADE HE DAW BACK IN A
HUY   A LAGE PIGEON HAD FLOWN INTO HE FACE  AND WAS BEATING
HE VIOLENTLY WITH ITS WINGS 

 SEPENT   SCEAMED THE PIGEON 

 I M NOT A SEPENT   SAID ALICE INDIGNANTLY    LET ME ALONE  

 SEPENT  I SAY AGAIN   EPEATED THE PIGEON  BUT IN A MOE
SUBDUED TONE  AND ADDED WITH A KIND OF SOB   I VE TIED EVEY

 I HAVEN T THE LEAST IDEA WHAT YOU E TALKING ABOUT   SAID
ALICE 

 I VE TIED THE OOTS OF TEES  AND I VE TIED BANKS  AND I VE
TIED HEDGES   THE PIGEON WENT ON  WITHOUT ATTENDING TO HE   BUT
THOSE SEPENTS   THEE S NO PLEASING THEM  

ALICE WAS MOE AND MOE PUZZLED  BUT SHE THOUGHT THEE WAS NO
USE IN SAYING ANYTHING MOE TILL THE PIGEON HAD FINISHED 

 AS IF IT WASN T TOUBLE ENOUGH HATCHING THE EGGS   SAID THE
PIGEON   BUT I MUST BE ON THE LOOK OUT FO SEPENTS NIGHT AND
DAY   WHY  I HAVEN T HAD A WINK OF SLEEP THESE THEE WEEKS  

 I M VEY SOY YOU VE BEEN ANNOYED   SAID ALICE  WHO WAS
BEGINNING TO SEE ITS MEANING 

 AND JUST AS I D TAKEN THE HIGHEST TEE IN THE WOOD   CONTINUED
THE PIGEON  AISING ITS VOICE TO A SHIEK   AND JUST AS I WAS
THINKING I SHOULD BE FEE OF THEM AT LAST  THEY MUST NEEDS COME
WIGGLING DOWN FOM THE SKY   UGH  SEPENT  

 BUT I M NOT A SEPENT  I TELL YOU   SAID ALICE    I M A  I M
A   

 WELL   WHAT AE YOU   SAID THE PIGEON    I CAN SEE YOU E
TYING TO INVENT SOMETHING  

 I  I M A LITTLE GIL   SAID ALICE  ATHE DOUBTFULLY  AS SHE
EMEMBEED THE NUMBE OF CHANGES SHE HAD GONE THOUGH THAT DAY 

 A LIKELY STOY INDEED   SAID THE PIGEON IN A TONE OF THE
DEEPEST CONTEMPT    I VE SEEN A GOOD MANY LITTLE GILS IN MY
TIME  BUT NEVE ONE WITH SUCH A NECK AS THAT   NO  NO   YOU E A
SEPENT  AND THEE S NO USE DENYING IT   I SUPPOSE YOU LL BE
TELLING ME NEXT THAT YOU NEVE TASTED AN EGG  

 I HAVE TASTED EGGS  CETAINLY   SAID ALICE  WHO WAS A VEY
TUTHFUL CHILD   BUT LITTLE GILS EAT EGGS UUITE AS MUCH AS
SEPENTS DO  YOU KNOW  

 I DON T BELIEVE IT   SAID THE PIGEON   BUT IF THEY DO  WHY
THEN THEY E A KIND OF SEPENT  THAT S ALL I CAN SAY  

THIS WAS SUCH A NEW IDEA TO ALICE  THAT SHE WAS UUITE SILENT
FO A MINUTE O TWO  WHICH GAVE THE PIGEON THE OPPOTUNITY OF
ADDING   YOU E LOOKING FO EGGS  I KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH  AND
WHAT DOES IT MATTE TO ME WHETHE YOU E A LITTLE GIL O A
SEPENT  

 IT MATTES A GOOD DEAL TO ME   SAID ALICE HASTILY   BUT I M
NOT LOOKING FO EGGS  AS IT HAPPENS  AND IF I WAS  I SHOULDN T
WANT YOUS   I DON T LIKE THEM AW  

 WELL  BE OFF  THEN   SAID THE PIGEON IN A SULKY TONE  AS IT
SETTLED DOWN AGAIN INTO ITS NEST   ALICE COUCHED DOWN AMONG THE
TEES AS WELL AS SHE COULD  FO HE NECK KEPT GETTING ENTANGLED
AMONG THE BANCHES  AND EVEY NOW AND THEN SHE HAD TO STOP AND
UNTWIST IT   AFTE A WHILE SHE EMEMBEED THAT SHE STILL HELD THE
PIECES OF MUSHOOM IN HE HANDS  AND SHE SET TO WOK VEY
CAEFULLY  NIBBLING FIST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHE  AND
GOWING SOMETIMES TALLE AND SOMETIMES SHOTE  UNTIL SHE HAD
SUCCEEDED IN BINGING HESELF DOWN TO HE USUAL HEIGHT 

IT WAS SO LONG SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ANYTHING NEA THE IGHT SIZE 
THAT IT FELT UUITE STANGE AT FIST  BUT SHE GOT USED TO IT IN A
FEW MINUTES  AND BEGAN TALKING TO HESELF  AS USUAL    COME 
THEE S HALF MY PLAN DONE NOW   HOW PUZZLING ALL THESE CHANGES

OPEN PLACE  WITH A LITTLE HOUSE IN IT ABOUT FOU FEET HIGH 
 WHOEVE LIVES THEE   THOUGHT ALICE   IT LL NEVE DO TO COME
UPON THEM THIS SIZE   WHY  I SHOULD FIGHTEN THEM OUT OF THEI

NOT VENTUE TO GO NEA THE HOUSE TILL SHE HAD BOUGHT HESELF

CHAPTE VI

PIG AND PEPPE


FO A MINUTE O TWO SHE STOOD LOOKING AT THE HOUSE  AND
WONDEING WHAT TO DO NEXT  WHEN SUDDENLY A FOOTMAN IN LIVEY CAME
UNNING OUT OF THE WOOD   SHE CONSIDEED HIM TO BE A FOOTMAN
BECAUSE HE WAS IN LIVEY   OTHEWISE  JUDGING BY HIS FACE ONLY 
SHE WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM A FISH   AND APPED LOUDLY AT THE DOO
WITH HIS KNUCKLES   IT WAS OPENED BY ANOTHE FOOTMAN IN LIVEY 
WITH A OUND FACE  AND LAGE EYES LIKE A FOG  AND BOTH FOOTMEN 
ALICE NOTICED  HAD POWDEED HAI THAT CULED ALL OVE THEI
HEADS   SHE FELT VEY CUIOUS TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT  AND
CEPT A LITTLE WAY OUT OF THE WOOD TO LISTEN 

THE FISH FOOTMAN BEGAN BY PODUCING FOM UNDE HIS AM A GEAT
LETTE  NEALY AS LAGE AS HIMSELF  AND THIS HE HANDED OVE TO
THE OTHE  SAYING  IN A SOLEMN TONE   FO THE DUCHESS   AN

EPEATED  IN THE SAME SOLEMN TONE  ONLY CHANGING THE ODE OF THE
WODS A LITTLE   FOM THE UUEEN   AN INVITATION FO THE DUCHESS
TO PLAY COUUET  

THEN THEY BOTH BOWED LOW  AND THEI CULS GOT ENTANGLED
TOGETHE 

ALICE LAUGHED SO MUCH AT THIS  THAT SHE HAD TO UN BACK INTO
THE WOOD FO FEA OF THEI HEAING HE  AND WHEN SHE NEXT PEEPED
OUT THE FISH FOOTMAN WAS GONE  AND THE OTHE WAS SITTING ON THE
GOUND NEA THE DOO  STAING STUPIDLY UP INTO THE SKY 

ALICE WENT TIMIDLY UP TO THE DOO  AND KNOCKED 

 THEE S NO SOT OF USE IN KNOCKING   SAID THE FOOTMAN   AND
THAT FO TWO EASONS   FIST  BECAUSE I M ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE
DOO AS YOU AE  SECONDLY  BECAUSE THEY E MAKING SUCH A NOISE
INSIDE  NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HEA YOU    AND CETAINLY THEE WAS
A MOST EXTAODINAY NOISE GOING ON WITHIN  A CONSTANT HOWLING
AND SNEEZING  AND EVEY NOW AND THEN A GEAT CASH  AS IF A DISH
O KETTLE HAD BEEN BOKEN TO PIECES 

 PLEASE  THEN   SAID ALICE   HOW AM I TO GET IN  

 THEE MIGHT BE SOME SENSE IN YOU KNOCKING   THE FOOTMAN WENT
ON WITHOUT ATTENDING TO HE   IF WE HAD THE DOO BETWEEN US   FO
INSTANCE  IF YOU WEE INSIDE  YOU MIGHT KNOCK  AND I COULD LET
YOU OUT  YOU KNOW    HE WAS LOOKING UP INTO THE SKY ALL THE TIME
HE WAS SPEAKING  AND THIS ALICE THOUGHT DECIDEDLY UNCIVIL    BUT
PEHAPS HE CAN T HELP IT   SHE SAID TO HESELF   HIS EYES AE SO
VEY NEALY AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD   BUT AT ANY ATE HE MIGHT
ANSWE UUESTIONS   HOW AM I TO GET IN   SHE EPEATED  ALOUD 

 I SHALL SIT HEE   THE FOOTMAN EMAKED   TILL TOMOOW   

AT THIS MOMENT THE DOO OF THE HOUSE OPENED  AND A LAGE PLATE
CAME SKIMMING OUT  STAIGHT AT THE FOOTMAN S HEAD   IT JUST
GAZED HIS NOSE  AND BOKE TO PIECES AGAINST ONE OF THE TEES
BEHIND HIM 

   O NEXT DAY  MAYBE   THE FOOTMAN CONTINUED IN THE SAME TONE 
EXACTLY AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED 

 HOW AM I TO GET IN   ASKED ALICE AGAIN  IN A LOUDE TONE 

 AE YOU TO GET IN AT ALL   SAID THE FOOTMAN    THAT S THE
FIST UUESTION  YOU KNOW

 IT S EALLY DEADFUL   SHE MUTTEED TO HESELF   THE WAY ALL THE
CEATUES AGUE   IT S ENOUGH TO DIVE ONE CAZY  

THE FOOTMAN SEEMED TO THINK THIS A GOOD OPPOTUNITY FO
EPEATING HIS EMAK  WITH VAIATIONS    I SHALL SIT HEE   HE
SAID   ON AND OFF  FO DAYS AND DAYS  

 BUT WHAT AM I TO DO   SAID ALICE 

 ANYTHING YOU LIKE   SAID THE FOOTMAN  AND BEGAN WHISTLING 

 OH  THEE S NO USE IN TALKING TO HIM   SAID ALICE DESPEATELY 
 HE S PEFECTLY IDIOTIC    AND SHE OPENED THE DOO AND WENT IN 

THE DOO LED IGHT INTO A LAGE KITCHEN  WHICH WAS FULL OF
SMOKE FOM ONE END TO THE OTHE   THE DUCHESS WAS SITTING ON A
THEE LEGGED STOOL IN THE MIDDLE  NUSING A BABY  THE COOK WAS
LEANING OVE THE FIE  STIING A LAGE CAULDON WHICH SEEMED TO
BE FULL OF SOUP 

 THEE S CETAINLY TOO MUCH PEPPE IN THAT SOUP   ALICE SAID TO
HESELF  AS WELL AS SHE COULD FO SNEEZING 

THEE WAS CETAINLY TOO MUCH OF IT IN THE AI   EVEN THE
DUCHESS SNEEZED OCCASIONALLY  AND AS FO THE BABY  IT WAS
SNEEZING AND HOWLING ALTENATELY WITHOUT A MOMENT S PAUSE   THE
ONLY THINGS IN THE KITCHEN THAT DID NOT SNEEZE  WEE THE COOK 
AND A LAGE CAT WHICH WAS SITTING ON THE HEATH AND GINNING FOM

 PLEASE WOULD YOU TELL ME   SAID ALICE  A LITTLE TIMIDLY  FO
SHE WAS NOT UUITE SUE WHETHE IT WAS GOOD MANNES FO HE TO
SPEAK FIST   WHY YOU CAT GINS LIKE THAT  

 IT S A CHESHIE CAT   SAID THE DUCHESS   AND THAT S WHY   PIG  

SHE SAID THE LAST WOD WITH SUCH SUDDEN VIOLENCE THAT ALICE
UUITE JUMPED  BUT SHE SAW IN ANOTHE MOMENT THAT IT WAS ADDESSED
TO THE BABY  AND NOT TO HE  SO SHE TOOK COUAGE  AND WENT ON
AGAIN   

 I DIDN T KNOW THAT CHESHIE CATS ALWAYS GINNED  IN FACT  I
DIDN T KNOW THAT CATS COULD GIN

 I DON T KNOW OF ANY THAT DO   ALICE SAID VEY POLITELY 
FEELING UUITE PLEASED TO HAVE GOT INTO A CONVESATION 

 YOU DON T KNOW MUCH   SAID THE DUCHESS   AND THAT S A FACT  

ALICE DID NOT AT ALL LIKE THE TONE OF THIS EMAK  AND THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO INTODUCE SOME OTHE SUBJECT OF
CONVESATION   WHILE SHE WAS TYING TO FIX ON ONE  THE COOK TOOK
THE CAULDON OF SOUP OFF THE FIE  AND AT ONCE SET TO WOK
THOWING EVEYTHING WITHIN HE EACH AT THE DUCHESS AND THE BABY
  THE FIE IONS CAME FIST  THEN FOLLOWED A SHOWE OF SAUCEPANS 
PLATES  AND DISHES   THE DUCHESS TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEM EVEN WHEN
THEY HIT HE  AND THE BABY WAS HOWLING SO MUCH ALEADY  THAT IT
WAS UUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHETHE THE BLOWS HUT IT O NOT 

 OH  PLEASE MIND WHAT YOU E DOING   CIED ALICE  JUMPING UP
AND DOWN IN AN AGONY OF TEO    OH  THEE GOES HIS PECIOUS
NOSE   AS AN UNUSUALLY LAGE SAUCEPAN FLEW CLOSE BY IT  AND VEY
NEALY CAIED IT OFF 

 IF EVEYBODY MINDED THEI OWN BUSINESS   THE DUCHESS SAID IN A
HOASE GOWL   THE WOLD WOULD GO OUND A DEAL FASTE THAN IT
DOES  

 WHICH WOULD NOT BE AN ADVANTAGE   SAID ALICE  WHO FELT VEY
GLAD TO GET AN OPPOTUNITY OF SHOWING OFF A LITTLE OF HE
KNOWLEDGE    JUST THINK OF WHAT WOK IT WOULD MAKE WITH THE DAY
AND NIGHT   YOU SEE THE EATH TAKES TWENTY FOU HOUS TO TUN
OUND ON ITS AXIS   

 TALKING OF AXES   SAID THE DUCHESS   CHOP OFF HE HEAD  

ALICE GLANCED ATHE ANXIOUSLY AT THE COOK  TO SEE IF SHE MEANT
TO TAKE THE HINT  BUT THE COOK WAS BUSILY STIING THE SOUP  AND
SEEMED NOT TO BE LISTENING  SO SHE WENT ON AGAIN    TWENTY FOU
HOUS  I THINK  O IS IT TWELVE   I   

 OH  DON T BOTHE ME   SAID THE DUCHESS   I NEVE COULD ABIDE
FIGUES    AND WITH THAT SHE BEGAN NUSING HE CHILD AGAIN 
SINGING A SOT OF LULLABY TO IT AS SHE DID SO  AND GIVING IT A
VIOLENT SHAKE AT THE END OF EVEY LINE 

 SPEAK OUGHLY TO YOU LITTLE BOY 
AND BEAT HIM WHEN HE SNEEZES 
HE ONLY DOES IT TO ANNOY 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT TEASES  

CHOUS 

 IN WHICH THE COOK AND THE BABY JOINED    

 WOW  WOW  WOW  

WHILE THE DUCHESS SANG THE SECOND VESE OF THE SONG  SHE KEPT
TOSSING THE BABY VIOLENTLY UP AND DOWN  AND THE POO LITTLE THING
HOWLED SO  THAT ALICE COULD HADLY HEA THE WODS   

 I SPEAK SEVEELY TO MY BOY 
I BEAT HIM WHEN HE SNEEZES 
FO HE CAN THOOUGHLY ENJOY
THE PEPPE WHEN HE PLEASES  

CHOUS 

 WOW  WOW  WOW  

 HEE  YOU MAY NUSE IT A BIT  IF YOU LIKE   THE DUCHESS SAID
TO ALICE  FLINGING THE BABY AT HE AS SHE SPOKE    I MUST GO AND
GET EADY TO PLAY COUUET WITH THE UUEEN   AND SHE HUIED OUT OF
THE OOM   THE COOK THEW A FYING PAN AFTE HE AS SHE WENT OUT 
BUT IT JUST MISSED HE 

ALICE CAUGHT THE BABY WITH SOME DIFFICULTY  AS IT WAS A UUEE 
SHAPED LITTLE CEATUE  AND HELD OUT ITS AMS AND LEGS IN ALL
DIECTIONS   JUST LIKE A STA FISH   THOUGHT ALICE   THE POO
LITTLE THING WAS SNOTING LIKE A STEAM ENGINE WHEN SHE CAUGHT IT 
AND KEPT DOUBLING ITSELF UP AND STAIGHTENING ITSELF OUT AGAIN 
SO THAT ALTOGETHE  FO THE FIST MINUTE O TWO  IT WAS AS MUCH
AS SHE COULD DO TO HOLD IT 

AS SOON AS SHE HAD MADE OUT THE POPE WAY OF NUSING IT 
 WHICH WAS TO TWIST IT UP INTO A SOT OF KNOT  AND THEN KEEP
TIGHT HOLD OF ITS IGHT EA AND LEFT FOOT  SO AS TO PEVENT ITS
UNDOING ITSELF   SHE CAIED IT OUT INTO THE OPEN AI    IF I
DON T TAKE THIS CHILD AWAY WITH ME   THOUGHT ALICE   THEY E SUE
TO KILL IT IN A DAY O TWO   WOULDN T IT BE MUDE TO LEAVE IT
BEHIND    SHE SAID THE LAST WODS OUT LOUD  AND THE LITTLE THING
GUNTED IN EPLY  IT HAD LEFT OFF SNEEZING BY THIS TIME     DON T
GUNT   SAID ALICE   THAT S NOT AT ALL A POPE WAY OF EXPESSING
YOUSELF  

THE BABY GUNTED AGAIN  AND ALICE LOOKED VEY ANXIOUSLY INTO
ITS FACE TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTE WITH IT   THEE COULD BE NO
DOUBT THAT IT HAD A VEY TUN UP NOSE  MUCH MOE LIKE A SNOUT
THAN A EAL NOSE  ALSO ITS EYES WEE GETTING EXTEMELY SMALL FO
A BABY   ALTOGETHE ALICE DID NOT LIKE THE LOOK OF THE THING AT
ALL    BUT PEHAPS IT WAS ONLY SOBBING   SHE THOUGHT  AND LOOKED
INTO ITS EYES AGAIN  TO SEE IF THEE WEE ANY TEAS 

NO  THEE WEE NO TEAS    IF YOU E GOING TO TUN INTO A PIG 
MY DEA   SAID ALICE  SEIOUSLY   I LL HAVE NOTHING MOE TO DO
WITH YOU   MIND NOW    THE POO LITTLE THING SOBBED AGAIN  O
GUNTED  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHICH   AND THEY WENT ON FO
SOME WHILE IN SILENCE 

ALICE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO THINK TO HESELF   NOW  WHAT AM I
TO DO WITH THIS CEATUE WHEN I GET IT HOME   WHEN IT GUNTED
AGAIN  SO VIOLENTLY  THAT SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO ITS FACE IN SOME
ALAM   THIS TIME THEE COULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT   IT WAS
NEITHE MOE NO LESS THAN A PIG  AND SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE
UUITE ABSUD FO HE TO CAY IT FUTHE 

SO SHE SET THE LITTLE CEATUE DOWN  AND FELT UUITE ELIEVED TO
SEE IT TOT AWAY UUIETLY INTO THE WOOD    IF IT HAD GOWN UP  
SHE SAID TO HESELF   IT WOULD HAVE MADE A DEADFULLY UGLY CHILD

SHOUTED IN EPLY 

 THAT S IGHT   SHOUTED THE UUEEN    CAN YOU PLAY COUUET  

THE SOLDIES WEE SILENT  AND LOOKED AT ALICE  AS THE UUESTION
WAS EVIDENTLY MEANT FO HE 

 YES   SHOUTED ALICE 

 COME ON  THEN   OAED THE UUEEN  AND ALICE JOINED THE
POCESSION  WONDEING VEY MUCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT 

 IT S  IT S A VEY FINE DAY   SAID A TIMID VOICE AT HE SIDE 
SHE WAS WALKING BY THE WHITE ABBIT  WHO WAS PEEPING ANXIOUSLY
INTO HE FACE 

 VEY   SAID ALICE      WHEE S THE DUCHESS  

 HUSH   HUSH   SAID THE ABBIT IN A LOW  HUIED TONE   HE
LOOKED ANXIOUSLY OVE HIS SHOULDE AS HE SPOKE  AND THEN AISED
HIMSELF UPON TIPTOE  PUT HIS MOUTH CLOSE TO HE EA  AND
WHISPEED  SHE S UNDE SENTENCE OF EXECUTION  

 WHAT FO   SAID ALICE 

 DID YOU SAY  WHAT A PITY     THE ABBIT ASKED 

 NO  I DIDN T   SAID ALICE    I DON T THINK IT S AT ALL A PITY 
I SAID  WHAT FO   

 SHE BOXED THE UUEEN S EAS    THE ABBIT BEGAN   ALICE GAVE A
LITTLE SCEAM OF LAUGHTE    OH  HUSH   THE ABBIT WHISPEED IN A
FIGHTENED TONE    THE UUEEN WILL HEA YOU   YOU SEE  SHE CAME
ATHE LATE  AND THE UUEEN SAID   

 GET TO YOU PLACES   SHOUTED THE UUEEN IN A VOICE OF THUNDE 
AND PEOPLE BEGAN UNNING ABOUT IN ALL DIECTIONS  TUMBLING UP
AGAINST EACH OTHE  HOWEVE  THEY GOT SETTLED DOWN IN A MINUTE O
TWO  AND THE GAME BEGAN   ALICE THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVE SEEN SUCH A
CUIOUS COUUET GOUND IN HE LIFE  IT WAS ALL IDGES AND
FUOWS  THE BALLS WEE LIVE HEDGEHOGS  THE MALLETS LIVE
FLAMINGOES  AND THE SOLDIES HAD TO DOUBLE THEMSELVES UP AND TO
STAND ON THEI HANDS AND FEET  TO MAKE THE ACHES 

THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY ALICE FOUND AT FIST WAS IN MANAGING HE
FLAMINGO   SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ITS BODY TUCKED AWAY 
COMFOTABLY ENOUGH  UNDE HE AM  WITH ITS LEGS HANGING DOWN 
BUT GENEALLY  JUST AS SHE HAD GOT ITS NECK NICELY STAIGHTENED
OUT  AND WAS GOING TO GIVE THE HEDGEHOG A BLOW WITH ITS HEAD  IT
WOULD TWIST ITSELF OUND AND LOOK UP IN HE FACE  WITH SUCH A
PUZZLED EXPESSION THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BUSTING OUT LAUGHING 
AND WHEN SHE HAD GOT ITS HEAD DOWN  AND WAS GOING TO BEGIN AGAIN 
IT WAS VEY POVOKING TO FIND THAT THE HEDGEHOG HAD UNOLLED
ITSELF  AND WAS IN THE ACT OF CAWLING AWAY   BESIDES ALL THIS 
THEE WAS GENEALLY A IDGE O FUOW IN THE WAY WHEEVE SHE
WANTED TO SEND THE HEDGEHOG TO  AND  AS THE DOUBLED UP SOLDIES
WEE ALWAYS GETTING UP AND WALKING OFF TO OTHE PATS OF THE
GOUND  ALICE SOON CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS A VEY
DIFFICULT GAME INDEED 

THE PLAYES ALL PLAYED AT ONCE WITHOUT WAITING FO TUNS 
UUAELLING ALL THE WHILE  AND FIGHTING FO THE HEDGEHOGS  AND IN
A VEY SHOT TIME THE UUEEN WAS IN A FUIOUS PASSION  AND WENT
STAMPING ABOUT  AND SHOUTING  OFF WITH HIS HEAD   O  OFF WITH
HE HEAD   ABOUT ONCE IN A MINUTE 

ALICE BEGAN TO FEEL VEY UNEASY   TO BE SUE  SHE HAD NOT AS
YET HAD ANY DISPUTE WITH THE UUEEN  BUT SHE KNEW THAT IT MIGHT
HAPPEN ANY MINUTE   AND THEN   THOUGHT SHE   WHAT WOULD BECOME OF
ME   THEY E DEADFULLY FOND OF BEHEADING PEOPLE HEE  THE GEAT
WONDE IS  THAT THEE S ANY ONE LEFT ALIVE  

SHE WAS LOOKING ABOUT FO SOME WAY OF ESCAPE  AND WONDEING
WHETHE SHE COULD GET AWAY WITHOUT BEING SEEN  WHEN SHE NOTICED A
CUIOUS APPEAANCE IN THE AI   IT PUZZLED HE VEY MUCH AT
FIST  BUT  AFTE WATCHING IT A MINUTE O TWO  SHE MADE IT OUT TO
BE A GIN  AND SHE SAID TO HESELF  IT S THE CHESHIE CAT   NOW I
SHALL HAVE SOMEBODY TO TALK TO  

 HOW AE YOU GETTING ON   SAID THE CAT  AS SOON AS THEE WAS
MOUTH ENOUGH FO IT TO SPEAK WITH 

ALICE WAITED TILL THE EYES APPEAED  AND THEN NODDED    IT S NO
USE SPEAKING TO IT   SHE THOUGHT   TILL ITS EAS HAVE COME  O AT
LEAST ONE OF THEM    IN ANOTHE MINUTE THE WHOLE HEAD APPEAED 
AND THEN ALICE PUT DOWN HE FLAMINGO  AND BEGAN AN ACCOUNT OF THE
GAME  FEELING VEY GLAD SHE HAD SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO HE   THE
CAT SEEMED TO THINK THAT THEE WAS ENOUGH OF IT NOW IN SIGHT  AND
NO MOE OF IT APPEAED 

 I DON T THINK THEY PLAY AT ALL FAILY   ALICE BEGAN  IN ATHE
A COMPLAINING TONE   AND THEY ALL UUAEL SO DEADFULLY ONE CAN T
HEA ONESELF SPEAK  AND THEY DON T SEEM TO HAVE ANY ULES IN
PATICULA  AT LEAST  IF THEE AE  NOBODY ATTENDS TO THEM  AND
YOU VE NO IDEA HOW CONFUSING IT IS ALL THE THINGS BEING ALIVE 
FO INSTANCE  THEE S THE ACH I VE GOT TO GO THOUGH NEXT
WALKING ABOUT AT THE OTHE END OF THE GOUND  AND I SHOULD HAVE
COUUETED THE UUEEN S HEDGEHOG JUST NOW  ONLY IT AN AWAY WHEN IT
SAW MINE COMING  

 HOW DO YOU LIKE THE UUEEN   SAID THE CAT IN A LOW VOICE 

 NOT AT ALL   SAID ALICE    SHE S SO EXTEMELY     JUST THEN
SHE NOTICED THAT THE UUEEN WAS CLOSE BEHIND HE  LISTENING   SO
SHE WENT ON     LIKELY TO WIN  THAT IT S HADLY WOTH WHILE
FINISHING THE GAME  

THE UUEEN SMILED AND PASSED ON 

 WHO AE YOU TALKING TO   SAID THE KING  GOING UP TO ALICE  AND
LOOKING AT THE CAT S HEAD WITH GEAT CUIOSITY 

 IT S A FIEND OF MINE  A CHESHIE CAT   SAID ALICE    ALLOW ME
TO INTODUCE IT  

 I DON T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT AT ALL   SAID THE KING 
 HOWEVE  IT MAY KISS MY HAND IF IT LIKES  

 I D ATHE NOT   THE CAT EMAKED 

 DON T BE IMPETINENT   SAID THE KING   AND DON T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT    HE GOT BEHIND ALICE AS HE SPOKE 

 A CAT MAY LOOK AT A KING   SAID ALICE    I VE EAD THAT IN
SOME BOOK  BUT I DON T EMEMBE WHEE  

 WELL  IT MUST BE EMOVED   SAID THE KING VEY DECIDEDLY  AND
HE CALLED THE UUEEN  WHO WAS PASSING AT THE MOMENT   MY DEA   I
WISH YOU WOULD HAVE THIS CAT EMOVED  

THE UUEEN HAD ONLY ONE WAY OF SETTLING ALL DIFFICULTIES  GEAT
O SMALL    OFF WITH HIS HEAD   SHE SAID  WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING
OUND 

 I LL FETCH THE EXECUTIONE MYSELF   SAID THE KING EAGELY  AND
HE HUIED OFF 

ALICE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK  AND SEE HOW THE GAME
WAS GOING ON  AS SHE HEAD THE UUEEN S VOICE IN THE DISTANCE 
SCEAMING WITH PASSION   SHE HAD ALEADY HEAD HE SENTENCE THEE
OF THE PLAYES TO BE EXECUTED FO HAVING MISSED THEI TUNS  AND
SHE DID NOT LIKE THE LOOK OF THINGS AT ALL  AS THE GAME WAS IN
SUCH CONFUSION THAT SHE NEVE KNEW WHETHE IT WAS HE TUN O
NOT   SO SHE WENT IN SEACH OF HE HEDGEHOG 

THE HEDGEHOG WAS ENGAGED IN A FIGHT WITH ANOTHE HEDGEHOG 
WHICH SEEMED TO ALICE AN EXCELLENT OPPOTUNITY FO COUUETING ONE
OF THEM WITH THE OTHE   THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS  THAT HE
FLAMINGO WAS GONE ACOSS TO THE OTHE SIDE OF THE GADEN  WHEE
ALICE COULD SEE IT TYING IN A HELPLESS SOT OF WAY TO FLY UP
INTO A TEE 

BY THE TIME SHE HAD CAUGHT THE FLAMINGO AND BOUGHT IT BACK 
THE FIGHT WAS OVE  AND BOTH THE HEDGEHOGS WEE OUT OF SIGHT 
 BUT IT DOESN T MATTE MUCH   THOUGHT ALICE   AS ALL THE ACHES
AE GONE FOM THIS SIDE OF THE GOUND    SO SHE TUCKED IT AWAY
UNDE HE AM  THAT IT MIGHT NOT ESCAPE AGAIN  AND WENT BACK FO
A LITTLE MOE CONVESATION WITH HE FIEND 

WHEN SHE GOT BACK TO THE CHESHIE CAT  SHE WAS SUPISED TO
FIND UUITE A LAGE COWD COLLECTED OUND IT   THEE WAS A DISPUTE
GOING ON BETWEEN THE EXECUTIONE  THE KING  AND THE UUEEN  WHO
WEE ALL TALKING AT ONCE  WHILE ALL THE EST WEE UUITE SILENT 
AND LOOKED VEY UNCOMFOTABLE 

THE MOMENT ALICE APPEAED  SHE WAS APPEALED TO BY ALL THEE TO
SETTLE THE UUESTION  AND THEY EPEATED THEI AGUMENTS TO HE 
THOUGH  AS THEY ALL SPOKE AT ONCE  SHE FOUND IT VEY HAD INDEED
TO MAKE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID 

THE EXECUTIONE S AGUMENT WAS  THAT YOU COULDN T CUT OFF A
HEAD UNLESS THEE WAS A BODY TO CUT IT OFF FOM   THAT HE HAD
NEVE HAD TO DO SUCH A THING BEFOE  AND HE WASN T GOING TO BEGIN
AT HIS TIME OF LIFE 

THE KING S AGUMENT WAS  THAT ANYTHING THAT HAD A HEAD COULD BE
BEHEADED  AND THAT YOU WEEN T TO TALK NONSENSE 

THE UUEEN S AGUMENT WAS  THAT IF SOMETHING WASN T DONE ABOUT
IT IN LESS THAN NO TIME SHE D HAVE EVEYBODY EXECUTED  ALL OUND 
 IT WAS THIS LAST EMAK THAT HAD MADE THE WHOLE PATY LOOK SO
GAVE AND ANXIOUS  

ALICE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE TO SAY BUT  IT BELONGS TO THE
DUCHESS   YOU D BETTE ASK HE ABOUT IT  

 SHE S IN PISON   THE UUEEN SAID TO THE EXECUTIONE    FETCH
HE HEE    AND THE EXECUTIONE WENT OFF LIKE AN AOW 

THE CAT S HEAD BEGAN FADING AWAY THE MOMENT HE WAS GONE  AND 
BY THE TIME HE HAD COME BACK WITH THE DUTCHESS  IT HAD ENTIELY
DISAPPEAED  SO THE KING AND THE EXECUTIONE AN WILDLY UP AND DOWN
LOOKING FO IT  WHILE THE EST OF THE PATY WENT BACK TO THE GAME

DIGGING HE SHAP LITTLE CHIN INTO ALICE S SHOULDE AS SHE ADDED

 OH  DON T TALK ABOUT TOUBLE   SAID THE DUCHESS    I MAKE YOU
A PESENT OF EVEYTHING I VE SAID AS YET  

 A CHEAP SOT OF PESENT   THOUGHT ALICE    I M GLAD THEY DON T

 LET S GO ON WITH THE GAME   THE UUEEN SAID TO ALICE  AND ALICE
WAS TOO MUCH FIGHTENED TO SAY A WOD  BUT SLOWLY FOLLOWED HE
BACK TO THE COUUET GOUND 

THE OTHE GUESTS HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UUEEN S ABSENCE 
AND WEE ESTING IN THE SHADE   HOWEVE  THE MOMENT THEY SAW HE 
THEY HUIED BACK TO THE GAME  THE UUEEN MEELY EMAKING THAT A

UGLIFY IS  YOU AE A SIMPLETON  

ALICE DID NOT FEEL ENCOUAGED TO ASK ANY MOE UUESTIONS ABOUT
IT  SO SHE TUNED TO THE MOCK TUTLE  AND SAID  WHAT ELSE HAD YOU

BEING UPSET  AND THEI SLATES AND PENCILS HAD BEEN FOUND AND
HANDED BACK TO THEM  THEY SET TO WOK VEY DILIGENTLY TO WITE
OUT A HISTOY OF THE ACCIDENT  ALL EXCEPT THE LIZAD  WHO SEEMED

GAZING UP INTO THE OOF OF THE COUT

THE WHITE ABBIT INTEUPTED    UNIMPOTANT  YOU MAJESTY MEANS 
OF COUSE   HE SAID IN A VEY ESPECTFUL TONE  BUT FOWNING AND
MAKING FACES AT HIM AS HE SPOKE 

 UNIMPOTANT  OF COUSE  I MEANT   THE KING HASTILY SAID  AND
WENT ON TO HIMSELF IN AN UNDETONE   IMPOTANT  UNIMPOTANT  
UNIMPOTANT  IMPOTANT    AS IF HE WEE TYING WHICH WOD
SOUNDED BEST 

SOME OF THE JUY WOTE IT DOWN  IMPOTANT   AND SOME
 UNIMPOTANT    ALICE COULD SEE THIS  AS SHE WAS NEA ENOUGH TO
LOOK OVE THEI SLATES   BUT IT DOESN T MATTE A BIT   SHE
THOUGHT TO HESELF

WITING IN HIS NOTE BOOK  CACKLED OUT  SILENCE   AND EAD OUT
FOM HIS BOOK   ULE FOTY TWO   ALL PESONS MOE THAN A MILE

JUST BEEN PICKED UP  

 WHAT S IN IT   SAID THE UUEEN 

 I HAVEN T OPENED IT YET   SAID THE WHITE ABBIT   BUT IT SEEMS
TO BE A LETTE  WITTEN BY THE PISONE TO  TO SOMEBODY  

 IT MUST HAVE BEEN THAT   SAID THE KING   UNLESS IT WAS
WITTEN TO NOBODY  WHICH ISN T USUAL  YOU KNOW  

 WHO IS IT DIECTED TO   SAID ONE OF THE JUYMEN 

 IT ISN T DIECTED AT ALL   SAID THE WHITE ABBIT   IN FACT 
THEE S NOTHING WITTEN ON THE OUTSIDE    HE UNFOLDED THE PAPE
AS HE SPOKE  AND ADDED  IT ISN T A LETTE  AFTE ALL   IT S A SET
OF VESES

MATTE WOSE   YOU MUST HAVE MEANT SOME MISCHIEF  O ELSE YOU D
HAVE SIGNED YOU NAME LIKE AN HONEST MAN  

THEE WAS A GENEAL CLAPPING OF HANDS AT THIS   IT WAS THE
FIST EALLY CLEVE THING THE KING HAD SAID THAT DAY 

 THAT POVES HIS GUILT   SAID THE UUEEN 

 IT POVES NOTHING OF THE SOT   SAID ALICE    WHY  YOU DON T

PLEASE YOU MAJESTY   HE ASKED

TILL YOU COME TO THE END   THEN STOP  

THESE WEE THE VESES THE WHITE ABBIT EAD   

 THEY TOLD ME YOU HAD BEEN TO HE 
AND MENTIONED ME TO HIM 
SHE GAVE ME A GOOD CHAACTE 
BUT SAID I COULD NOT SWIM

BETWEEN YOUSELF AND ME

SAID THE KING  UBBING HIS HANDS   SO NOW LET THE JUY   

 IF ANY ONE OF THEM CAN EXPLAIN IT   SAID ALICE   SHE HAD
GOWN SO LAGE IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT SHE WASN T A BIT
AFAID OF INTEUPTING HIM    I LL GIVE HIM SIXPENCE    I  DON T
BELIEVE THEE S AN ATOM OF MEANING IN IT  

THE JUY ALL WOTE DOWN ON THEI SLATES   SHE DOESN T BELIEVE
THEE S AN ATOM OF MEANING IN IT   BUT NONE OF THEM ATTEMPTED TO
EXPLAIN THE PAPE 

 IF THEE S NO MEANING IN IT   SAID THE KING   THAT SAVES A
WOLD OF TOUBLE  YOU KNOW  AS WE NEEDN T TY TO FIND ANY   AND
YET I DON T KNOW   HE WENT ON  SPEADING OUT THE VESES ON HIS
KNEE  AND LOOKING AT THEM WITH ONE EYE   I SEEM TO SEE SOME
MEANING IN THEM  AFTE ALL      SAID I COULD NOT SWIM    YOU
CAN T SWIM  CAN YOU   HE ADDED  TUNING TO THE KNAVE 

THE KNAVE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY    DO I LOOK LIKE IT   HE SAID 
 WHICH HE CETAINLY DID NOT  BEING MADE ENTIELY OF CADBOAD

THAT MUST BE WHAT HE DID WITH THE TATS  YOU KNOW   

 BUT  IT GOES ON  THEY ALL ETUNED FOM HIM TO YOU    SAID
ALICE 

 WHY  THEE THEY AE   SAID THE KING TIUMPHANTLY  POINTING TO
THE TATS ON THE TABLE    NOTHING CAN BE CLEAE THAN THAT 
THEN AGAIN   BEFOE SHE HAD THIS FIT     YOU NEVE HAD FITS  MY
DEA  I THINK   HE SAID TO THE UUEEN

LIZAD AS SHE SPOKE    THE UNFOTUNATE LITTLE BILL HAD LEFT OFF
WITING ON HIS SLATE WITH ONE FINGE  AS HE FOUND IT MADE NO
MAK  BUT HE NOW HASTILY BEGAN AGAIN  USING THE INK  THAT WAS
TICKLING DOWN HIS FACE  AS LONG AS IT LASTED  

 THEN THE WODS DON T FIT YOU   SAID THE KING  LOOKING OUND
THE COUT WITH A SMILE   THEE WAS A DEAD SILENCE 

 IT S A PUN   THE KING ADDED IN AN OFFENDED TONE  AND
EVEYBODY LAUGHED   LET THE JUY CONSIDE THEI VEDICT   THE
KING SAID  FO ABOUT THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT DAY 

 NO  NO   SAID THE UUEEN    SENTENCE FIST  VEDICT AFTEWADS  

 STUFF AND NONSENSE   SAID ALICE LOUDLY    THE IDEA OF HAVING
THE SENTENCE FIST  

 HOLD YOU TONGUE   SAID THE UUEEN  TUNING PUPLE 

 I WON T   SAID ALICE 

 OFF WITH HE HEAD   THE UUEEN SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HE VOICE 
NOBODY MOVED 

 WHO CAES FO YOU   SAID ALICE   SHE HAD GOWN TO HE FULL
SIZE BY THIS TIME     YOU E NOTHING BUT A PACK OF CADS  

AT THIS THE WHOLE PACK OSE UP INTO THE AI  AND CAME FLYING
DOWN UPON HE   SHE GAVE A LITTLE SCEAM  HALF OF FIGHT AND HALF
OF ANGE  AND TIED TO BEAT THEM OFF  AND FOUND HESELF LYING ON
THE BANK  WITH HE HEAD IN THE LAP OF HE SISTE  WHO WAS GENTLY
BUSHING AWAY SOME DEAD LEAVES THAT HAD FLUTTEED DOWN FOM THE
TEES UPON HE FACE 

 WAKE UP  ALICE DEA   SAID HE SISTE   WHY  WHAT A LONG
SLEEP YOU VE HAD  

 OH  I VE HAD SUCH A CUIOUS DEAM   SAID ALICE  AND SHE TOLD
HE SISTE  AS WELL AS SHE COULD EMEMBE THEM  ALL THESE STANGE
ADVENTUES OF HES THAT YOU HAVE JUST BEEN EADING ABOUT  AND
WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED  HE SISTE KISSED HE  AND SAID   IT WAS A
CUIOUS DEAM  DEA  CETAINLY   BUT NOW UN IN TO YOU TEA  IT S
GETTING LATE    SO ALICE GOT UP AND AN OFF  THINKING WHILE SHE
AN  AS WELL SHE MIGHT  WHAT A WONDEFUL DEAM IT HAD BEEN 

BUT HE SISTE SAT STILL JUST AS SHE LEFT HE  LEANING HE
HEAD ON HE HAND  WATCHING THE SETTING SUN  AND THINKING OF
LITTLE ALICE AND ALL HE WONDEFUL ADVENTUES  TILL SHE TOO BEGAN
DEAMING AFTE A FASHION  AND THIS WAS HE DEAM   

FIST  SHE DEAMED OF LITTLE ALICE HESELF  AND ONCE AGAIN THE
TINY HANDS WEE CLASPED UPON HE KNEE  AND THE BIGHT EAGE EYES
WEE LOOKING UP INTO HES  SHE COULD HEA THE VEY TONES OF HE
VOICE  AND SEE THAT UUEE LITTLE TOSS OF HE HEAD TO KEEP BACK
THE WANDEING HAI THAT WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO HE EYES  AND
STILL AS SHE LISTENED  O SEEMED TO LISTEN  THE WHOLE PLACE
AOUND HE BECAME ALIVE THE STANGE CEATUES OF HE LITTLE
SISTE S DEAM 

THE LONG GASS USTLED AT HE FEET AS THE WHITE ABBIT HUIED
BY  THE FIGHTENED MOUSE SPLASHED HIS WAY THOUGH THE
NEIGHBOUING POOL  SHE COULD HEA THE ATTLE OF THE TEACUPS AS
THE MACH HAE AND HIS FIENDS SHAED THEI NEVE ENDING MEAL 
AND THE SHILL VOICE OF THE UUEEN ODEING OFF HE UNFOTUNATE
GUESTS TO EXECUTION  ONCE MOE THE PIG BABY WAS SNEEZING ON THE
DUCHESS S KNEE  WHILE PLATES AND DISHES CASHED AOUND IT  ONCE
MOE THE SHIEK OF THE GYPHON  THE SUUEAKING OF THE LIZAD S
SLATE PENCIL  AND THE CHOKING OF THE SUPPESSED GUINEA PIGS 
FILLED THE AI  MIXED UP WITH THE DISTANT SOBS OF THE MISEABLE
MOCK TUTLE 

SO SHE SAT ON  WITH CLOSED EYES  AND HALF BELIEVED HESELF IN
WONDELAND  THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE HAD BUT TO OPEN THEM AGAIN  AND
ALL WOULD CHANGE TO DULL EALITY  THE GASS WOULD BE ONLY
USTLING IN THE WIND  AND THE POOL IPPLING TO THE WAVING OF THE
EEDS  THE ATTLING TEACUPS WOULD CHANGE TO TINKLING SHEEP 
BELLS  AND THE UUEEN S SHILL CIES TO THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHED
BOY  AND THE SNEEZE OF THE BABY  THE SHIEK OF THE GYPHON  AND
ALL THY OTHE UUEE NOISES  WOULD CHANGE  SHE KNEW  TO THE
CONFUSED CLAMOU OF THE BUSY FAM YAD  WHILE THE LOWING OF THE
CATTLE IN THE DISTANCE WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE MOCK TUTLE S
HEAVY SOBS 

LASTLY  SHE PICTUED TO HESELF HOW THIS SAME LITTLE SISTE OF
HES WOULD  IN THE AFTE TIME  BE HESELF A GOWN WOMAN  AND HOW
SHE WOULD KEEP  THOUGH ALL HE IPE YEAS  THE SIMPLE AND
LOVING HEAT OF HE CHILDHOOD   AND HOW SHE WOULD GATHE ABOUT
HE OTHE LITTLE CHILDEN  AND MAKE THEI EYES BIGHT AND EAGE
WITH MANY A STANGE TALE  PEHAPS EVEN WITH THE DEAM OF
WONDELAND OF LONG AGO   AND HOW SHE WOULD FEEL WITH ALL THEI
SIMPLE SOOWS  AND FIND A PLEASUE IN ALL THEI SIMPLE JOYS 
EMEMBEING HE OWN CHILD LIFE  AND THE HAPPY SUMME DAYS 

THE END

THE NEXT KEYWOD IS UPLIFTWAR
